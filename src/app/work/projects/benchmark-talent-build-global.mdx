# Benchmarking with the Best to Build Better Here

## About This Initiative

This initiative explores what it takes to create technology solutions from Bangladesh that can compete globally.

For me, this is about more than just building software. It is about architecting solutions, leading teams, and setting a vision that aligns with global standards. The focus is on developing an environment where innovation, quality, and talent are recognized and valued appropriately.

## Why It Matters

When local markets undervalue innovation and expertise, competitiveness suffers. Talented professionals seek opportunities elsewhere, and the ecosystem loses its ability to produce solutions that can stand shoulder-to-shoulder with those built in the most advanced markets.

Benchmarking against global leaders such as the United States is not about ignoring local realities — it is about using them as a foundation and pushing ourselves to achieve more. It is about closing the gap so that Bangladeshi talent and products can thrive internationally.

## What This Initiative Involves

- Researching global benchmarks for talent costs, product quality, and innovation models
- Documenting structural and cultural challenges to valuing talent fairly
- Sharing insights on how to elevate standards in local teams and organizations
- Encouraging businesses, investors, and policymakers to embrace a world-class mindset

## Key Outcomes

This initiative ultimately shaped the foundation of **Valiant Technologies**, a company dedicated to building globally competitive products while placing strong emphasis on talent retention.

Valiant Technologies reflects the vision of aligning local capabilities with international benchmarks and demonstrates how Bangladeshi teams can deliver innovation at a global scale. It continues to:

- **Improve Talent Retention** – by providing opportunities that value expertise competitively
- **Raise Product Quality** – by embedding global best practices into solution design and delivery
- **Attract Global Partnerships** – by showcasing Bangladesh as a hub capable of delivering world-class solutions
- **Shift Mindsets** – by proving that innovation and talent from Bangladesh can achieve global impact

## The Goal

To inspire an ecosystem where Bangladeshi talent can reach its full potential without leaving the country, and where solutions built here can compete, scale, and be celebrated on a global stage.
