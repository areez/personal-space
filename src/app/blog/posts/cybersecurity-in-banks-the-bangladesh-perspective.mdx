## Cybersecurity in Banks: The Bangladesh Perspective

Banking is about trust, and nothing erodes trust faster than a breach. Globally, banks invest heavily in cybersecurity. In Bangladesh, the journey is ongoing—progress has been made, but gaps remain.

## The Risks

- **Legacy infrastructure**: Core banking systems not designed for today’s threats.  
- **SMS OTP reliance**: Still dominant despite known weaknesses.  
- **Awareness gaps**: Employees and customers vulnerable to phishing and scams.  
- **Resource asymmetry**: Attackers innovate faster than regulators adapt.  

---
## What’s Improving

- Central bank circulars on cybersecurity frameworks.  
- Gradual adoption of two-factor authentication beyond SMS.  
- Investments in SOCs (Security Operations Centers).  
- Training programs for IT and risk officers.

## My Perspective

Cybersecurity in Bangladesh banks can’t just be about compliance checklists. It must be about **resilience**: assuming breaches will happen, and designing systems to detect, contain, and recover quickly. It means adopting **zero trust** architectures, investing in **behavioral analytics**, and creating **incident response muscle memory**.

The threats are real, but so are the opportunities. With the right mix of regulation, investment, and mindset, Bangladesh’s banking sector can leapfrog into resilience instead of patchwork defenses.
