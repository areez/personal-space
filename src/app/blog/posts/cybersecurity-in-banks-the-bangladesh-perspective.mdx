## Cybersecurity in Banks — The Bangladesh Perspective

Banks are the backbone of an economy, and in Bangladesh they are also among the most digitally active institutions. From mobile banking apps to real-time gross settlement systems, banks handle billions of takas in digital transactions daily. With this digital expansion comes heightened risk. Cybersecurity in banking is no longer a technical issue; it is a strategic imperative.

### The Global Threat Landscape

Globally, banks are prime targets for cybercrime. The Bangladesh Bank heist of 2016 remains one of the most infamous examples, where attackers attempted to steal nearly USD 1 billion via SWIFT. Although most transfers were blocked, USD 81 million was lost. This incident put Bangladesh at the center of global cybersecurity discussions and highlighted vulnerabilities in banking systems.

Since then, threats have only grown. Ransomware attacks, phishing campaigns, insider threats, and advanced persistent threats all target financial institutions. The cost of cybercrime to the banking sector worldwide is estimated in the hundreds of billions annually. For developing markets, the risks are amplified by resource constraints and regulatory gaps.

### Local Realities

In Bangladesh, several realities shape banking cybersecurity. Many banks run legacy systems that are difficult to patch. Skills shortages mean that cybersecurity teams are often understaffed. Regulatory compliance is improving but enforcement remains inconsistent. As digital banking adoption grows—mobile apps, agent banking, e-wallets—the attack surface widens.

### Lessons from SMS OTP

The persistence of SMS OTP as a security measure illustrates the tension between convenience and security. As I have argued elsewhere, SMS OTP is vulnerable to interception and fraud. Yet many banks retain it because of customer familiarity. Stronger methods like app-based authentication or hardware tokens remain rare.

### Regulatory and Institutional Roles

Bangladesh Bank has taken steps to strengthen cybersecurity. Guidelines on ICT security, requirements for incident reporting, and audits are positive moves. But regulations alone are insufficient. Banks must view cybersecurity as an investment, not a compliance checkbox. Boards and executives must understand that resilience requires continuous funding and strategic alignment.

### The Way Forward

The way forward involves layered defenses. Strong authentication, real-time monitoring, AI-driven anomaly detection, and incident response plans are necessary. Collaboration among banks, regulators, and international partners is also critical. Information sharing about threats can prevent repeat attacks. Finally, building a cybersecurity culture among employees is essential—technology alone cannot prevent phishing or social engineering.

### Conclusion

Cybersecurity in banks is a moving target. For Bangladesh, the stakes are high: financial stability, investor confidence, and consumer trust depend on it. The lesson from past incidents is clear: the cost of inaction is far higher than the cost of preparedness. The future of banking will be digital, but whether it will be secure depends on the choices made today.
