## Mobile Payments in Bangladesh — Growth, Risks, and Why We Need Escrow at Scale

Bangladesh has undergone a remarkable transformation in financial services over the past decade. What once was a largely cash-based economy has shifted into one where mobile wallets, QR payments, and digital gateways are part of everyday life. Services like bKash, Nagad, Rocket, and Upay have enabled millions to transact digitally. According to recent estimates, more than 119 million mobile financial service (MFS) accounts exist in Bangladesh, with billions of transactions being processed every month.

This growth story, however, comes with real challenges. I have observed from both the perspective of a technology consultant and as a consumer that rapid adoption has not always been accompanied by robust safeguards. In particular, the absence of reliable settlement mechanisms and trusted intermediaries has created friction and sometimes outright fraud. Merchants occasionally find their funds delayed; customers sometimes worry about failed reversals. Here lies the case for escrow.

### The Rise of Mobile Payments

Bangladesh’s journey in mobile payments is intertwined with financial inclusion. Traditional banking systems struggled to reach rural and low-income populations. Mobile phones filled this gap. By 2025, mobile penetration exceeded 100% (measured by SIM connections), and with regulatory backing from Bangladesh Bank, MFS companies built ecosystems enabling payments, transfers, salary disbursements, and utility bill settlements.

The convenience is undeniable. From street vendors to e-commerce shops, accepting mobile money has become normal. Remittances from abroad often flow directly into wallets. The impact on financial inclusion has been transformative. Yet beneath the success stories lies structural fragility.

### Settlement Risks and Merchant Pain

Merchants form the backbone of any payment system. In Bangladesh, they are often the first to highlight systemic weaknesses. I have heard numerous cases of settlement delays—sometimes hours, sometimes days—where funds do not arrive in merchant accounts. For small and medium enterprises, cash flow interruptions can be catastrophic. Salaries may be delayed, supplier payments missed, or stock replenishment disrupted.

In advanced markets, regulatory frameworks demand that customer payments be protected through mechanisms like escrow, insurance, or settlement guarantees. In Bangladesh, while rules exist, enforcement and implementation lag. This creates an environment where unscrupulous or undercapitalized payment gateway providers can exploit merchants. In extreme cases, firms collapse, leaving businesses unpaid.

### Fraud and Trust Deficits

Fraud is another recurring theme. Fake gateways have appeared, promising lower transaction fees, only to vanish with merchant funds. Customers, too, face scams ranging from phishing to social engineering. Without mechanisms to hold funds securely until both parties fulfill obligations, disputes escalate quickly. Trust is eroded, and adoption suffers.

The lack of trust has a multiplier effect: established businesses hesitate to scale digital acceptance, regulators become cautious in approving innovation, and consumers fall back to cash. Escrow is one of the oldest solutions to such dilemmas, ensuring that funds are only released once conditions are met.

### Escrow as the Missing Layer

An escrow service acts as a neutral third party. In the context of mobile payments and e-commerce in Bangladesh, this would mean customer funds are held securely until delivery is confirmed, services rendered, or disputes resolved. Escrow removes the asymmetry of power between small merchants and large intermediaries or between customers and unknown online sellers.

Globally, escrow is standard in online marketplaces. Platforms like eBay integrated it early to build trust. In China, Alipay’s escrow model was crucial in driving e-commerce adoption by ensuring buyers felt safe transacting online. Bangladesh can learn from these models.

### Regulatory Role and Central Bank’s Opportunity

For escrow to work, the regulator must take initiative. Bangladesh Bank has an opportunity to introduce standardized escrow services for MFS and payment gateways, much like it did when it formalized mobile financial services a decade ago. Licensing neutral escrow providers, setting reserve requirements, and mandating dispute resolution timelines would elevate trust dramatically.

This is not just theoretical. In countries like India, the Reserve Bank mandated strict settlement and escrow rules for payment gateways, ensuring customer funds were never co-mingled with company operational accounts. Similar rules in Bangladesh could prevent future collapses and ensure systemic stability.

### Building for the Future

As someone who has worked on cloud-based platforms, I believe escrow in Bangladesh must also be technology-driven. APIs for e-commerce platforms, integration with mobile wallets, and transparent dashboards for regulators could make escrow seamless. With cloud and blockchain, real-time settlement visibility is possible. Merchants, customers, and banks could track funds with confidence.

### Conclusion

The story of mobile payments in Bangladesh is both inspiring and incomplete. The infrastructure exists, adoption is strong, and consumer behavior has shifted. But without strong safeguards, the ecosystem remains fragile. Escrow can be that safeguard. By holding funds neutrally and releasing them fairly, escrow ensures that trust— the currency on which all financial systems run—remains intact.

The next chapter in Bangladesh’s digital financial journey must therefore include escrow at scale. Only then can mobile payments truly fulfill their promise of inclusive, resilient, and trustworthy finance.
