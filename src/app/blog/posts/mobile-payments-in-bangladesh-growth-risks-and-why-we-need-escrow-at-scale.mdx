## Mobile Payments in Bangladesh: Growth Is Real. Now We Need Escrow at Scale.

Bangladesh is rightly proud of its mobile payments boom. **bKash** and peers normalized digital transfers for the mass market—utility bills, merchant QR, P2P, cash‑in/cash‑out. But scale revealed the next challenge: **settlement discipline** and **merchant trust**. Too many merchants have stories of being paid late—or not at all—by fragile or unprofessional gateways. For SMEs, cash flow is oxygen. Uncertainty kills momentum.

## What Trust Looks Like in Mature Markets

Look at how platforms like **PayPal** and **Alipay** earned trust: they used **escrow**. Money doesn’t go straight to the merchant; it sits with a regulated intermediary and is released when the buyer confirms delivery—or after a time window if there’s no dispute. It’s simple economics: escrow reduces counterparty risk and increases participation.

In Bangladesh, we have **Digital Commerce Operational Guidelines** that reference escrow arrangements for e‑commerce, but practice is uneven. If we want the next 10 million consumers and the next 1 million merchants to fully commit, we need **escrow as a first‑class rail**, not a checkbox.

## How Escrow Could Work—Operationally

1. **Payment** → Customer pays into an escrow account tied to an order.  
2. **Fulfillment signal** → Courier scan + seller dispatch marks the order shipped.  
3. **Delivery confirmation** → Customer confirmation or courier proof triggers release.  
4. **Time‑boxed auto‑release** → If the buyer doesn’t respond within X days, funds auto‑settle.  
5. **Disputes** → Documented timelines, buyer/seller evidence, and an appeals path.  
6. **Settlement SLAs** → Clear **T+1 / T+2** policies with penalties for delays.

Technically, this can ride on existing MFS (mobile financial services) and banking rails with **escrow accounts** supervised by regulated entities. The key is **transparency**: all parties should be able to see status without chasing emails.

## The Role of the Central Bank

A central bank doesn’t have to run the escrow service—but it should **set the rules of the game**: licensing, capitalization, consumer protection, dispute norms, audit requirements, and data retention. Done right, we’d end up with **licensed escrow providers** (banks, PSPs, MFS operators) competing on service quality, not on who can delay payout the longest.

## Why This Matters Now

- **Merchant confidence**: Faster, predictable settlements grow the pie.  
- **Consumer protection**: Refunds and non‑delivery cases become standardized.  
- **E‑commerce reputation**: A few high‑profile failures set the entire sector back. Escrow creates a floor of trust.

## My Experience (and Frustration)

During the 2023 connectivity disruptions, even reaching support teams was hard. Some businesses literally flew teams to neighboring countries to stay online; **SMEs suffered at home**. In that context, weak settlement practices felt like salt in the wound. We can fix this—**escrow is a policy and product decision**, not a moonshot.

If you lead a PSP, gateway, or large marketplace, your next growth unlock isn’t another flashy feature; it’s **discipline and trust**. Escrow is both.
