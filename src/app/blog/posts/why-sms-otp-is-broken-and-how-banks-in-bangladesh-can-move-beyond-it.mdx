## Why SMS OTP is Broken and How Banks Can Move Beyond It

When news of fraud cases involving compromised SMS OTPs reached me, it wasn’t a surprise. For years, security experts have warned about vulnerabilities in SMS-based authentication. Yet many banks in Bangladesh continue to rely on it, exposing both themselves and their customers to risk.

### Understanding the Risks

SMS OTP was once seen as a convenient second factor. But the global security community has documented how easily it can be exploited. Protocol-level flaws like SS7 allow attackers to intercept SMS traffic. SIM swap fraud and cloning can give criminals access to OTPs meant for the original user. Malware and insider abuse add further vulnerabilities. The false sense of security SMS OTP creates is one of its greatest dangers.

### Why It Persists

Despite the risks, SMS OTP persists because of cost, simplicity, and widespread mobile adoption. For banks, deploying app-based authentication or hardware tokens requires investment and customer training. Regulators also often set minimal standards, allowing SMS OTP to remain acceptable. And customers, used to receiving codes by text, resist change until they experience loss firsthand.

### The Way Forward

The alternatives are clear. Many banks globally have moved to app-based OTPs, biometric authentication, and hardware security keys. These methods remove reliance on insecure mobile networks and provide stronger protection. For Bangladesh, this means developing mobile banking apps with embedded authentication, promoting push notifications for transaction approval, and offering secure tokens for high-value clients.

### Regulatory Role

The regulator must act as a catalyst. By setting timelines to phase out SMS OTP and mandating stronger methods, it can shift the entire sector. Education campaigns will help customers understand why change is necessary, and subsidies or partnerships can reduce adoption costs for smaller banks.

### Conclusion

Security is not about what’s easiest—it’s about what’s resilient. SMS OTP was a bridge technology, but it cannot be the future. By adopting stronger methods now, banks in Bangladesh can prevent fraud, protect customers, and build the trust essential for digital finance to grow.
