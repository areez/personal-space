## Building FarmRoket: A Blockchain Traceability SaaS for Food Exports

When I began working with CropRocket Limited in Bangladesh’s seed business, I expected the usual lessons about crop science and farm productivity. What I discovered instead was a deeper systemic challenge: Bangladesh’s inability to export fresh produce directly to the United States or European Union. It wasn’t a matter of quality alone—it was about traceability. And that realization sparked the creation of FarmRoket.

### The Traceability Challenge

Exporters in Bangladesh relied on handwritten documentation, often filled at airports during packaging. These records failed the fundamental requirements of EU Regulation 178/2002, which requires traceability “at all stages of production, processing and distribution.” Similarly, the U.S. Food Safety Modernization Act placed detailed record-keeping expectations on high-risk foods. Without credible, verifiable systems, exporters faced the risk of entire shipments being rejected at the border.

### Research and Market Lessons

International development organizations such as USAID highlighted the importance of Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), contract farming, and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) protocols. Transparency was no longer optional—it was required. Global surveys reinforced this: more than 70% of consumers said they would pay more for transparent and sustainable products. Demand for end-to-end visibility was a market reality.

### Why Blockchain?

Centralized systems and paperwork are vulnerable to tampering. Blockchain provided a way to record farm-level practices, packaging details, and shipment logs immutably. In FarmRoket, farmers could log seed varieties and inputs, exporters could track packaging and logistics, and consumers could scan QR codes to see provenance. The ledger created trust among stakeholders without depending on a single gatekeeper.

### From MVP to Global SaaS

The minimum viable product we built demonstrated feasibility: farmers logging data via mobile apps, exporters adding packaging and logistics details, and regulators able to check immutable records. Even in its earliest form, FarmRoket made transparent trade possible.

The challenges were significant—educating farmers, persuading exporters, and navigating the lack of immediate enforcement. Yet the opportunity is global. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America face similar hurdles. As regulations tighten, demand for transparent, blockchain-backed traceability will accelerate. FarmRoket was built for this future.

### Conclusion

FarmRoket is more than a startup idea; it’s a necessity. Without robust traceability, exporters risk exclusion from key markets. With it, they gain trust, access, and competitive advantage. The journey from seeds to software taught me that technology, when aligned with compliance and market demand, can change the trajectory of entire industries.
