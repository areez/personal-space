## From Seeds to Software: Why I Built FarmRoket

I didn’t plan to become an AgriTech founder. My entry was sideways—through a partnership with a seed company called **CropRocket Limited**. On paper I was the “tech guy,” but I was standing in fields, talking to farmers, and tracing supply chains that stretched from villages to airports. The more I learned, the more one question kept repeating in my head: **Why can’t we export fresh produce from Bangladesh into high‑value markets at scale?**

The answer I found was simple and frustrating: **traceability**. Not the performative kind where someone fills out a form at the airport during packaging. Real, auditable traceability that survives regulatory scrutiny in Brussels or Washington and builds consumer trust at a supermarket shelf in Dubai or London.

## The Gatekeepers: EU 178/2002 and FDA FSMA 204

My turning point came when I dove into the legal and operational side of food exports. The EU’s **General Food Law—Regulation (EC) No 178/2002**—spells it out in **Article 18**: food business operators must ensure **traceability at all stages** of production, processing, and distribution. They must be able to identify the **one step back** (their supplier) and the **one step forward** (their customer) and produce that documentation quickly when requested.

In the United States, the **FDA’s Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) Section 204** set out the Food Traceability Rule and a **Food Traceability List (FTL)** with record‑keeping requirements for specified high‑risk foods. The message is clear: if you can’t **prove** where your food came from, how it was handled, and who touched it, you don’t get to sell in their markets—full stop.

Reading through USAID export readiness material and contract farming templates only reinforced this. Modern agriculture isn’t just seeds and soil—it’s **proof at scale**: geo‑tagged plots, recorded inputs, pesticide diaries, harvest logs, cold‑chain data, and chain‑of‑custody events that survive audits.

## Paper Isn’t Proof

For years, “traceability” during export in Bangladesh meant manual forms completed at packaging time, often just hours before cargo loaded. That system satisfies nobody. It can’t surface upstream practices (seed varietal, fertilizer and pesticide use, GAP compliance), it can’t convincingly track a product across handlers, and it can’t answer a regulator’s most basic question: *Show me the evidence.*

What exporters, regulators, retailers, and consumers need is a **shared foundation of truth**—a ledger that isn’t controlled by one party, can’t be quietly edited, and is accessible on demand. That’s why I built **FarmRoket** as a **blockchain‑backed traceability SaaS**.

## Why Blockchain (and Why Now)

Blockchain is not a buzzword when you use it for what it’s good at: **tamper‑evident, append‑only records** shared across organizations that don’t fully trust each other. In agri export, multiple entities—farmers, collection centers, processors, cold‑chain operators, logistics providers, exporters, importers, retailers, regulators—need a **single view** of the truth with **clear provenance**. A public or consortium chain brings the right properties: immutability, transparency (with controlled privacy), and verifiability.

### What FarmRoket tracks
- **Seed & plot provenance**: variety, lot IDs, geofenced plots, sowing/harvest dates.  
- **Inputs & practices**: fertilizer and pesticide logs aligned to GAP benchmarks.  
- **Process events**: washing, grading, packing, cold‑store ingress/egress with timestamps and handlers.  
- **Logistics & export**: container IDs, airway bills, temperature breaches, customs events.  
- **Retail & consumer**: shelf‑readiness, QR scans, and consumer‑visible product journeys.

### The user experience
- **Farm‑edge apps** (low‑friction Android) for farmers and field officers.  
- **Exporter console** for batch creation, documentation, and audit trails.  
- **Regulator view** with targeted queries (“show me inputs for lot X,” “show me handlers in last 36 hours”).  
- **Consumer QR** that turns a label into a story, not a claim.

## The Data & Incentive Problem

Technology is the last mile. The first mile is incentives, training, and workflows that respect how food *actually* moves. In Bangladesh (and many similar markets), farmers are busy; field officers are stretched; exporters are wary of new overhead; and consumers are price‑sensitive. So FarmRoket’s MVP focused on **simplicity** and **clear value**:

- **On‑ramp**: Start with one crop, one district, a few motivated exporters.  
- **Minimal fields**: Capture what proves compliance; resist “data greed.”  
- **Feedback loop**: Analytics that reward good practices with higher acceptance rates and better buyer confidence.  
- **QR moments**: Give exporters and retailers a **marketing asset**—trusted transparency sells.

## Conversations that Shaped the Product

I sat with exporters, trade associations, farmers, and technologists. Exporters told me: *We know this is coming; we just don’t know when enforcement will bite.* Farmers said: *We will do what buyers pay for and what field officers support us to do.* Regulators said: *Make it auditable. If we can query it and rely on it, we’ll support it.*

That triangulation shaped FarmRoket’s priorities: **auditability**, **edge usability**, and **export value**.

---
## Architecture at a Glance

- **Edge capture**: Progressive web app + Android, lightweight offline cache, sync on connectivity.  
- **Core services**: Event pipeline, validation rules, anomaly detection (e.g., pesticide log out of cycle).  
- **Ledger**: Writes key events to a public/consortium blockchain with proofs anchored (Merkle commitments).  
- **Privacy**: Sensitive data (e.g., farmer identity) stays off‑chain with access controls; hashes and proofs on‑chain.  
- **Analytics**: Batch health scores, GAP conformance trends, export‑readiness reports.

## Where We Are Now

We shipped an MVP. It’s being extended with pilot partners. The market is early, but **regulatory pressure is rising**. As the EU and FDA continue to tighten expectations, a compliant, auditable chain of custody will shift from “nice to have” to **non‑negotiable**. When that happens, ready exporters will own the early advantage.

---
## Go‑to‑Market and Pricing

FarmRoket is designed as a **global SaaS** with local empathy. Pricing mirrors impact: start small per‑batch/per‑export fees, with enterprise tiers for exporters and retailers. For farmer networks and NGOs, we offer **sponsored onboarding** where large buyers underwrite the first mile. Adoption begins where urgency is highest—**exporters under regulatory pressure**—and grows to retailers and eventually consumers who scan and verify.

## What I Believe

- **Traceability isn’t a feature; it’s a license to operate** in premium markets.  
- **Proof beats promises**—for regulators, for retailers, and for consumers.  
- The winners will align **incentives + training + technology**. Doing one without the others just burns goodwill.

If you’re an exporter, regulator, or retailer who wants to **prove** your chain of custody rather than just **claim** it, that’s who I built FarmRoket for. The sooner we build trust into the food system, the more value flows back to the people who grow our food.
