## When the Internet Went Dark: Running an SME During Bangladesh’s 2023 Outage

2023 tested me in ways I didn’t expect. Bangladesh faced one of its longest and most disruptive internet outages. For large corporations, it was inconvenient. For SMEs like mine, it was devastating.

## The Impact

- **Client communications failed**: Customers couldn’t reach us.  
- **Maintenance work stalled**: Remote access, reboots, updates—all impossible.  
- **Teams sat idle**: Engineers who thrive on solving problems stared at blank screens.  
- **Business loss**: Some clients migrated to foreign providers. Some teams literally flew abroad to Nepal to continue working. We didn’t have that luxury.

## Lessons in Fragility

We talk about digital Bangladesh, but an outage exposed how fragile the ecosystem still is. Internet connectivity is not a luxury—it is infrastructure, as essential as electricity or water.

### What SMEs Need
- **Standard outage reporting**: Clear communication and ETAs.  
- **Redundant last-mile options**: Affordable dual providers or failover options.  
- **Offline business continuity playbooks**: SMS fallbacks, cached data, offline modes.

## My Reflection

That outage drove me crazy—not just financially but emotionally. Watching my team sit idle was heartbreaking. It reminded me that resilience isn’t just about technology. It’s about policy, planning, and mindset.

We need to treat connectivity as critical infrastructure. Until then, SMEs will remain vulnerable to every disruption.
