## When the Internet Went Dark — Running an SME Through Bangladesh&apos;s 2023 Outage

In October 2023, Bangladesh experienced one of its most disruptive internet outages in recent memory. Political unrest and regulatory measures resulted in days of connectivity loss across the country. For large corporations with offshore offices, the outage was a setback. For small and medium enterprises like ours, it was a crisis.

### Immediate Chaos

The first hours were filled with confusion. Teams tried to log in, servers were unreachable, clients abroad began sending anxious emails. Our operations—built on cloud systems, CRMs, and digital communications—were suddenly paralyzed. For a firm like Valiant, which managed IT for dozens of clients, the inability to deliver was both a technical and reputational risk.

### Coping Strategies

Some firms shifted operations abroad. A few flew their teams to Nepal or India. For us, such moves were impractical. Instead, we scrambled to adapt. We set up backup communication channels, leveraged mobile networks when available, and tried to maintain contact with international clients. But productivity dropped sharply. Deadlines were missed. Frustration grew.

### Lessons on Resilience

The outage exposed structural vulnerabilities. Bangladesh’s connectivity relied heavily on a few gateways, with little redundancy. SMEs like ours, without offshore facilities, bore the brunt. The lesson was clear: resilience must be built into systems, not improvised during crises.

For Valiant, this meant rethinking business continuity planning. We began investing in redundant internet links, exploring satellite backup options, and educating clients about risk management. The outage also revealed the need for regulatory reform: businesses cannot thrive if connectivity becomes collateral damage in political disputes.

### Conclusion

The 2023 outage was a dark chapter, but it offered clarity. For SMEs, digital transformation is not just about adopting cloud tools—it is about ensuring resilience against disruptions. Bangladesh must strengthen its digital infrastructure, diversify its connectivity, and protect businesses from collateral shocks. Only then can the promise of a digital economy be fulfilled.
