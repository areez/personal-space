## Reflections on My Journey

Looking back at my path—from business graduate to technologist, from startup founder to community leader—I see patterns. I see experiments that worked, and failures that taught me more than success ever did. I see risks taken, some rewarded, some redirected. I see the common thread of curiosity driving me forward.

## Key Lessons

- **Curiosity is fuel**: Every pivot, from travel to agriculture to cloud, started with a question.  
- **Trust compounds**: Building trust with clients, teams, and communities always paid dividends.  
- **Resilience matters**: Outages, failures, and mismatches hurt—but surviving them shaped me.

## Final Thought

My journey isn’t about one industry or one title. It’s about learning, building, and sharing. If there’s one thing I’d tell anyone reading this: **stay curious, stay resilient, and let trust be your strategy**.
