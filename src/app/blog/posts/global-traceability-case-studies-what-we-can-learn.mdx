## Case Study 1: Walmart and IBM Food Trust

Walmart partnered with IBM to build blockchain-based food traceability. A process that used to take 7 days—tracking mango origins—was reduced to 2.2 seconds. This demonstrated that scale and speed are possible when technology aligns with incentives.

## Case Study 2: EU Fisheries

The EU requires digital traceability for fish catches, linking vessels, landing ports, processors, and retailers. This reduced illegal fishing and built consumer trust. It shows how regulations can align with sustainability goals.

## Case Study 3: Pharma Supply Chains

The US Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) requires serialization and traceability of pharmaceuticals. This has reduced counterfeiting and increased patient safety. It demonstrates the stakes: traceability can literally save lives.
