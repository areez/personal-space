## Global Traceability Case Studies — What We Can Learn

While the theory of traceability is compelling, real-world case studies provide the strongest evidence of its value. Around the world, industries are experimenting with digital tools to ensure transparency. These examples show what works, what doesn’t, and what lessons Bangladesh can draw.

### Agriculture and Food Safety

In Europe, several supermarket chains have adopted blockchain systems to trace fresh produce from farm to shelf. Customers can scan QR codes to see farm practices, transport details, and certifications. These initiatives not only enhance food safety but also build brand loyalty. Farmers benefit from premium pricing when transparency is demonstrated.

In China, pork traceability projects have been implemented to restore consumer trust after food scandals. Blockchain and IoT sensors monitor every stage, reducing fraud and contamination. The lesson is that consumer trust, once lost, can only be rebuilt through transparency.

### Garments and Textiles

For Bangladesh’s garment sector, traceability is emerging as a critical issue. Global brands are under pressure to ensure ethical sourcing and environmental compliance. Some already require digital reporting on factory conditions, worker safety, and supply chains. Factories that can provide verified data stand to win contracts, while others risk being excluded.

### Mining and Electronics

The Democratic Republic of Congo, a major source of cobalt, has faced scrutiny over child labor. Blockchain pilots now track cobalt from mines to manufacturers, providing assurances to companies like Tesla and Apple. Similar efforts are emerging in electronics recycling, where traceability ensures compliance with environmental regulations.

### Lessons for Bangladesh

These global case studies illustrate a clear lesson: traceability builds resilience and competitiveness. For Bangladesh, adopting similar systems in agriculture and garments could open markets and protect industries from shocks. The challenge lies in building infrastructure, training stakeholders, and enforcing standards. The opportunity, however, is significant.

### Conclusion

Traceability is not theory—it is practice. The global evidence is clear: transparency drives trust, access, and competitiveness. Bangladesh cannot afford to lag. By learning from international case studies and adapting them locally, the country can position itself as a reliable player in global trade.
