## Cloud 2025: Where We’re Headed

When I look ahead to 2025, I see the cloud becoming less about “migration” and more about **optimization and intelligence**.

---
## Trends I See

- **Multi-cloud normalization**: Companies will spread workloads across providers for resilience and bargaining power.  
- **Sovereign clouds**: Nations will demand local data residency and compliance.  
- **AI-native cloud services**: Machine learning will be baked into infrastructure.  
- **Green cloud**: Sustainability metrics will influence vendor choice.

## My Prediction

In Bangladesh and similar markets, cloud will evolve from an “aspirational project” to an **operational necessity**. Businesses will stop asking *“Should we?”* and start asking *“How fast can we?”*. Local providers will rise, but global hyperscalers will still dominate.

The winners will be those who **optimize for cost, compliance, and resilience simultaneously**.

## My Advice

- Don’t just lift-and-shift—optimize workloads.  
- Build portability into your architecture.  
- Track carbon as a cost metric.  
- Invest in cloud skills internally; talent will remain the biggest bottleneck.  

Cloud 2025 isn’t about technology alone. It’s about choices that align cost, trust, and sustainability in one strategy.
