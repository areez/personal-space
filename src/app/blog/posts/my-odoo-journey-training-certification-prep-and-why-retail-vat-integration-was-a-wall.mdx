## My Odoo Journey: Functional Training, Partnership Highs, and Why Retail VAT Integration Broke the Deal

I have a lot of respect for **Odoo**. It’s one of the few ERPs that actually lives up to the promise of being modular, extensible, and friendly to SMEs. I took it seriously enough to complete **Functional Training across modules** and prepare for certification as a Functional Expert. We even became an **Odoo Partner in Bangladesh**—and maintained that partnership for two years.

This is the story of why I believed, what worked, and why we ultimately **chose not to continue** the partnership.

## What I Loved About Odoo

- **Breadth with coherence**: CRM, Sales, Accounting, Inventory, HR, Manufacturing, POS—Odoo felt like a well‑designed suite, not a pile of bolt‑ons.  
- **Standardization**: Sensible defaults, a consistent UI, and workflows that made sense for many industries.  
- **SaaS economics**: For mature customers, pay‑as‑you‑go and continuous upgrades are a gift.

As an integrator, I liked that I could onboard teams quickly and **deliver value fast**. For a while, it felt like the perfect match for Bangladesh’s SME market.

## Where the Friction Started

Three realities pushed back hard:

1. **One‑time mindset**: Many clients want a one‑time implementation and a one‑time payment. The idea of paying for ongoing updates, bug fixes, and maintenance feels “optional” to them—even when it’s essential.  
2. **Retail VAT fiscal devices (EFD)**: Retail POS implementations needed **fiscal device integrations** for VAT compliance. The ecosystem and modules weren’t ready enough locally; stitching it together became **expensive and brittle**.  
3. **Customization costs**: Odoo’s flexibility is real, but deep customizations (Python + ORM) add cost and long‑term maintenance. Many SMEs **don’t plan** for that TCO.

## The Moment of Decision

After two years, we had to be honest: **the market fit wasn’t there** for the way most local retailers purchase software. They wanted fixed‑cost projects and minimal ongoing fees. We wanted to deliver a living system with updates and support. The mismatch wasn’t Odoo’s fault—and it wasn’t the client’s fault either. It was **context**.

## What I Tell Retailers Now

- If you want **one‑and‑done**, skip Odoo and choose something simpler—even if it’s less powerful.  
- If you want **scalable operations**, budget for updates, integrations, and support; Odoo is fantastic when treated as a living product.  
- For VAT EFD integration, ask for demos and references first; avoid custom builds unless absolutely necessary.

## Respect Remains

I still like Odoo. For manufacturers, distributors, services, and retailers with the right mindset, it’s a serious platform. We ended the partnership because our local market realities—especially around retail VAT devices and pricing expectations—made success **too fragile**. That’s not defeat; it’s learning. And learning is how you keep building.
