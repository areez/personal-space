## JCI Bangladesh: A Journey of Leadership, Community, and Honest Reflection

I joined **JCI Bangladesh** because it combined two things I care about: the formality of a constitution-led organization and the informality of youth-led action. Between 2021 and 2023, I wore many hats—trainer, project organizer, committee member, and finally, a national leader. Each role taught me different dimensions of leadership.

---
## What Worked Well

- **Individual development**: JCI is a safe platform to practice public speaking, negotiation, and facilitation. Members grow by doing.  
- **Networking opportunities**: Corporate sponsorships and brand collaborations opened doors that would have taken years otherwise.  
- **Community service**: Small, repeatable projects in education and sustainability made tangible impacts.  

---
## Where We Struggled

- Too much emphasis on **titles and internal elections**. Leadership is treated as a prize, not a responsibility.  
- Not enough focus on **JCI’s core mission**: empowering young people through personal development, community projects, business, and global networking.  
- Conflicts and grouping sometimes overshadowed collaboration.

## My Honest Reflection

JCI gave me more than I gave it. I trained on **JCI Discover** and **JCI Explore**, facilitated workshops, and mentored members. I saw shy students transform into confident presenters. I saw members negotiate sponsorships with top corporations. These are wins.

But my advice to JCI Bangladesh is this: focus less on **who gets to lead internally each year**, and more on **what impact members create externally**. Leadership is a result, not a position.

## Why It Still Matters

JCI shaped my leadership style: disciplined, constitutional, and impact-driven. It gave me a community that keeps me grounded. And it reminded me that leadership is not about being in front—it’s about making others step up.
