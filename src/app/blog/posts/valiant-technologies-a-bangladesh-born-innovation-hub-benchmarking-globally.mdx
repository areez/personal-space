## Valiant Technologies® — A Bangladesh-born Innovation Hub Benchmarking Globally

In 2014, when I founded Valiant Technologies®, the technology landscape in Bangladesh was still young. The ICT sector was growing, outsourcing was in demand, but very few firms were thinking about global benchmarks or innovation ecosystems. Valiant was created with the conviction that a technology company born in Bangladesh could not only serve local needs but also deliver at global standards. This was not an easy belief to hold, but it became our compass.

### From Startup to Solutions Integrator

Valiant began as a small IT firm offering basic solutions—websites, apps, and network setups. But early on, I realized that commoditized services would never differentiate us. What businesses needed was a partner who could combine consulting with engineering, who could align technology with strategy. This insight shifted our trajectory from a service provider to a solutions integrator.

By 2018, Valiant had secured partnerships with international technology brands. We became an official solution provider of MikroTik, the global leader in networking equipment. We partnered with Hoteza, a European hospitality system provider. Each partnership was carefully chosen, not just for business but to align with our philosophy of benchmarking globally while building locally.

### The Odoo Chapter

Valiant also invested in ERP solutions, becoming a partner of Odoo—the world’s second-largest ERP system. Through Odoo we delivered ERP implementations for SMEs and enterprises in Bangladesh. The experience revealed both opportunities and challenges: Odoo brought global best practices, but local clients struggled with the SaaS mindset. We learned to adapt, localize, and educate.

### Benchmarking Through CIO-as-a-Service

One of our boldest moves was to launch a subscription-based CIO-as-a-Service model. For over 100 clients, this allowed SMEs to outsource their IT leadership. While local firms hesitated, international clients saw the value immediately. This experiment reinforced a lesson: the world was ready for such models, but Bangladesh needed time to adjust. Yet we persisted, because benchmarking means preparing for the future even when the present resists.

### Government and Defense Engagement

Valiant also engaged with government and defense IT projects. These were not only about delivering systems but about building trust. Public-sector projects tested our ability to comply with regulations, deliver at scale, and maintain security. The stakes were higher, but so were the lessons. Each project sharpened our ability to operate in complex environments.

### Looking Forward

Valiant today stands as more than an IT firm. It is a Bangladesh-born innovation hub that aspires to benchmark globally. We focus on cloud, SaaS, integration, and emerging technologies, but also on human capital, because innovation begins with people. Our journey has been one of persistence against skepticism, of embracing challenges as opportunities. If there is one message I want Valiant to embody, it is this: Bangladesh can build for the world, not just for itself.
