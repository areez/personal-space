## Introduction

Every time I meet founders, CTOs, or entrepreneurs in Bangladesh, one question comes up: *Can we build software globally while solving local problems?* The short answer is yes, and much of the answer lies in cloud computing and SaaS. These technologies shift capital from owning infrastructure to renting capability, enable remote delivery of services, and reduce friction in scaling. But as I’ve worked in this space with Valiant Technologies, in exports, ERP integrations like Odoo, and of course FarmRoket, I’ve seen both the promise and the friction firsthand.

Globally, the SaaS market was valued at **USD 266.23 billion in 2024** and is projected to grow to **USD 1,131.52 billion by 2032**, with an estimated CAGR of ~20%. Asia-Pacific (APAC) is expected to contribute a large portion of that growth, driven by countries embracing digital transformation. Meanwhile, in Bangladesh, the public cloud market is expected to grow at a CAGR of **25.4% between 2025-2031**.

So: what’s working, what’s not, and where do we go from here?

## The Promise of SaaS &amp; Cloud

Cloud + SaaS unlock many things that traditional on-prem or custom software rarely do:

- **Lower upfront cost, faster time to value.** Businesses, especially SMEs, avoid investing in expensive servers or data centers. They can subscribe, launch, and iterate.
- **Scaling &amp; flexibility.** Need more compute or storage? The cloud scales. Need more users or integrations? SaaS platforms often offer plug-and-play modules.
- **Global standards, compliance, security innovations.** Leading SaaS providers embed best practices in data security, backups, fault tolerance. For emerging markets, that means you inherit capabilities that might have taken years to build from scratch.
- **Market trends &amp; investor interest.** SaaS is attracting massive investment: the global market is forecasted to reach **USD 793.10 billion by 2029**, growing at ~19-20% annually.

In Bangladesh, digital infrastructure has improved. Internet penetration surpassed 54% in 2025. Mobile internet users number ~119 million, and 4G coverage is nearly universal. These trends make cloud SaaS solutions more feasible than ever before.

## Reality Check: What Holds Us Back

But the path isn’t seamless. Drawing from my work, here are the barriers I see:

1. **Mindset &amp; purchasing behavior.** Many clients expect one-time payment, perpetual licenses, or custom deployments, rather than subscription or recurring maintenance. The idea of paying monthly/annually with updates often feels strange when budgets are fixed or clients are used to traditional ownership.

2. **Connectivity &amp; reliability.** Despite 4G coverage and growing penetration, outages remain common. For cloud-native apps, downtime translates directly to business risk. Users in rural or less-urban areas still must contend with latency, spotty connections, power cuts—elements rarely considered in global SaaS designs.

3. **Localization &amp; regulatory friction.** VAT/fiscal device integration, compliance with local tax laws, language, and cultural expectations often require custom work. For example, with Odoo deployments, integrating VAT fiscal (EFD) machines for POS was both technically difficult and costly. Many SaaS platforms assume "global north" compliance, leaving gaps locally.

4. **Talent &amp; cost of support.** To build and maintain SaaS platforms to global expectations (security, reliability, devops, monitoring) you need skilled engineers. While talent exists, hiring, retention, and training come with real cost, especially for smaller companies competing with international firms.

5. **Investor &amp; customer expectations.** Churn, metrics, performance, SLAs—they matter. When a global provider can promise 99.9% uptime and 24/7 support, local entrants have to match up or clearly differentiate. Sometimes that requires trade-offs: cost vs margin, features vs simplicity.

## Cloud &amp; SaaS in Bangladesh: Where We Are

Let me share what I've observed locally:

- The **Bangladesh ICT market** was valued at around **USD 8 billion in 2024** and is projected to reach **USD 20 billion by 2032**, growing at a CAGR of approximately **12.1%**.
- Public cloud providers are increasingly tailoring services for SMEs. Small businesses are demanding simpler SLAs, local data centers, pricing in local currency.
- Exports, traceability, POS integrations, fintech & travel tech are among sectors moving fastest in adopting cloud and SaaS.

But in many cases, potential remains unrealized because of the friction points mentioned. What works tends to be hybrid: partial on-prem + cloud, lean SaaS modules rather than full-suite cloud deployments, and customer education around value of subscription vs upfront cost.

## Cloud 2025: So What’s Next?

Here are the trends I believe will shape the next few years—and how Bangladesh can be a leader, not just a follower:

- **Hybrid &amp; multi-cloud adoption.** Companies will increasingly distribute workloads across clouds for resilience, cost balance, and regulatory compliance. Local data centers will become more critical.
- **Edge computing &amp; offline resiliency.** For regions with unreliable connectivity, local caches, progressive sync, offline modes will become standard. Applications that can tolerate downtime (or sync smoothly after) will win.
- **AI-native cloud services.** Tools powered by machine learning (predictions, automation) will shift from novelty to standard features. SaaS platforms that bake in AI (data property, anomaly detection, demand forecasting) will leapfrog.
- **Green / sustainable cloud.** Global pressure (from buyers, regulators, consumers) will push providers to offer efficient, low-carbon cloud options. In Bangladesh, where power and infrastructure are constraints, energy-efficient operations will be a competitive differentiator.
- **More powerful regulatory frameworks.** Governments will need clearer policies around data residency, digital taxation, privacy, and standards for cloud &amp; SaaS providers (SLAs, uptime commitments, data export rules). These can either unlock confidence or create roadblocks.

## My Perspective &amp; Call to Action

From what I’ve learned in building across sectors:

- **Entrepreneurs** need to think globally but engineer locally. Build SaaS products that respect local tax/vat, payment systems, connectivity constraints—but can scale globally with modular design.
- **Policymakers &amp; regulators** in Bangladesh have a huge role: reducing friction around fiscal compliance, data privacy, and supporting infrastructure (reliable power, broadband, edge data centers) will matter.
- **Investors** need to understand that SaaS in emerging markets has different cost structures and timelines. Metrics like churn, ARR, uptime must be contextualized—not every market moves at Silicon Valley speeds.
- **Teams** must build for reliability, observability, and incremental trust. Every bug or downtime is a dent in confidence. Prioritize documentation, support, and customer education.

## Conclusion

Cloud and SaaS are not optional now—they are foundational for who wants to compete in the next decade. The numbers are clear: billions of dollars in growth, global demand for efficient tools, rising internet and mobile penetration even in markets we once thought too disconnected. Yet the true difference will come from execution: building with empathy for local constraints, pushing for regulatory clarity, designing for resilience as much as feature richness.

If you’re building a SaaS product in Bangladesh (or similar markets), don’t aim just to survive locally—aim to learn, benchmark globally, and deliver reliability. Do that, and the promise becomes reality.
