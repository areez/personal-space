## AR, IoT, and Blockchain in Supply Chains

Supply chains are messy. They involve farms, factories, trucks, ships, warehouses, and retailers. Each handoff introduces risk, opacity, and inefficiency. But three technologies—**Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and Blockchain**—are rewriting the rules.

## IoT: Data at the Edge

Sensors in trucks and warehouses measure temperature, humidity, and location. On farms, IoT tracks soil health, irrigation, and pesticide use. This data becomes the raw material for transparency.

---
## Blockchain: The Ledger of Proof

Data without trust is just noise. Blockchain ensures that IoT readings and human inputs are **immutable and auditable**. It links every sensor event and transaction in a chain that regulators, buyers, and consumers can trust.

---
## AR: Insight Made Visible

AR headsets and mobile apps make supply chain data **intuitive**. Instead of spreadsheets, warehouse staff see product provenance or quality alerts overlaid in their field of view. Retail buyers see the journey of goods projected in real time.

## The Convergence

- IoT generates data.  
- Blockchain secures data.  
- AR visualizes data.  

Together, they transform supply chains from black boxes into transparent, resilient networks.  

My conviction: supply chains of the future won’t just move goods—they’ll move **trust**. And these three technologies are at the heart of that shift.
