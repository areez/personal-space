## Tech in Supply Chains — AR, IoT &amp; Blockchain

Global supply chains are vast, complex networks that connect producers, logistics providers, retailers, and consumers. They are also fragile, as disruptions from pandemics, conflicts, or climate change have shown. Emerging technologies like Augmented Reality (AR), Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain offer tools to strengthen transparency, efficiency, and resilience.

### AR in Supply Chains

Augmented Reality enhances how workers interact with information. In warehouses, AR headsets can guide employees to the right shelves, reducing errors and training time. For logistics, AR can provide real-time visual overlays for packaging, loading, or maintenance. By blending digital data with the physical environment, AR improves productivity.

### IoT as the Nervous System

The Internet of Things connects sensors, vehicles, and machines into an intelligent network. In supply chains, IoT devices monitor temperature, humidity, location, and performance. For food exports, IoT ensures perishable goods remain within safe conditions. For manufacturers, IoT enables predictive maintenance. Real-time data creates visibility across the supply chain.

### Blockchain for Trust and Transparency

Trust remains a persistent challenge in supply chains. Where goods pass through multiple intermediaries, verifying origin, authenticity, and compliance is complex. Blockchain addresses this by providing an immutable ledger of transactions. Every step—from production to delivery—can be recorded and verified. Combined with IoT, blockchain ensures not just data collection but verifiable integrity.

### Integration and Challenges

The promise of AR, IoT, and blockchain is significant, but integration is not trivial. Costs, interoperability, and user adoption are barriers. For emerging markets like Bangladesh, the challenge is magnified by infrastructure gaps. Yet these technologies also offer the chance to leapfrog legacy systems, much as mobile payments leapfrogged banking.

### Conclusion

Supply chains will define the resilience of economies in the 21st century. By leveraging AR for human efficiency, IoT for machine intelligence, and blockchain for trust, businesses can build systems that withstand shocks. The journey is just beginning, but the direction is clear: technology will make supply chains smarter, faster, and more transparent.
