## Risk-Taking Psychology: How I Learned to Embrace Calculated Uncertainty

Entrepreneurship and risk are inseparable. When I started my ventures, from Valiant Technologies to FarmRoket, people often asked: *“How do you take these risks?”* The truth is, I don’t think of myself as reckless. I think of myself as someone who studies risks, calculates them, and then steps forward while others hesitate.

## The Mindset

- **See risk as data**: A risk isn’t a threat; it’s information. If you can map its probabilities and consequences, it becomes manageable.  
- **Opportunity cost matters**: The risk of *not acting* often outweighs the risk of acting. Waiting can be the biggest gamble.  
- **Experimentation mindset**: I try things in small, low-cost ways before scaling them. Pilots and MVPs are risk labs.

## Stories That Shaped Me

- Early in my tech journey, I bent CPU pins reinstalling hardware. I learned to take more care with delicate systems. The risk taught me precision.  
- At Microsoft Imagine Cup, we managed student projects under pressure. If we failed, students lost opportunities. That risk taught me responsibility.  
- With Odoo, we invested in a partnership that didn’t work out locally. That risk taught me adaptation.

## My Belief

Risk-taking isn’t bravado. It’s discipline, curiosity, and resilience. It’s knowing when to bet and when to fold. For me, entrepreneurship is not about avoiding uncertainty—it’s about learning to dance with it.
