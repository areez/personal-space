## Web3 Principles in My Product Philosophy

Web3 is often hyped as tokens, NFTs, and speculation. But when you strip away the noise, the **principles of Web3** resonate with how I think about building products.

---
## The Principles

- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure, no unilateral control.  
- **Transparency**: Ledgers and processes visible to all participants.  
- **Ownership**: Users own their data, assets, and identities.  
- **Composability**: Modular systems that interoperate seamlessly.  

---
## How I Apply This

- **FarmRoket**: Blockchain-based traceability where no one party owns the truth.  
- **Valiant Technologies**: Designing systems where customers aren’t locked in but empowered.  
- **Community work**: JCI projects where decision-making was participatory, not hierarchical.

## My Belief

You don’t need to build on Ethereum to embrace Web3 principles. You need to internalize the philosophy: **power should flow to the edges, not concentrate at the center**. That’s how you build resilient, trusted, future-ready systems.
