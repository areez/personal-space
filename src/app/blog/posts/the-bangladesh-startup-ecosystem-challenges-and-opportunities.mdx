## The Bangladesh Startup Ecosystem: Challenges and Opportunities

Having worked across technology, travel, and agriculture, I’ve seen how difficult—but also rewarding—it is to build startups in Bangladesh. The ecosystem has grown dramatically in the last decade, yet the same questions keep surfacing: *Are we ready?* and *What’s holding us back?*

## The Wins

- **Funding momentum**: From Pathao to ShopUp, we’ve seen startups raise significant rounds.  
- **Policy recognition**: Government increasingly speaks the language of innovation.  
- **Talent pool**: Young people are eager, skilled, and globally connected.

## The Frictions

- **Policy uncertainty**: Regulatory clarity lags behind innovation.  
- **Digital infrastructure gaps**: Outages, payments, logistics—too often unreliable.  
- **Investor hesitation**: Global investors remain cautious about governance and scale.  
- **Mindset gap**: Too many entrepreneurs chase valuation over value.

## My Reflection

I believe Bangladesh has the raw ingredients: a young population, rising digital adoption, and early proof points. What we need now is **discipline, governance, and patience**. Building startups is not a sprint. It’s a relay that requires ecosystems, not just heroes.
