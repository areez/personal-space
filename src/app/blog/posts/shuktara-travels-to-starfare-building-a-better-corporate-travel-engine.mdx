## Shuktara Travels to StarFare: Reinventing Corporate Travel in Bangladesh

Travel has always fascinated me—not just the act of going places but the systems that make movement possible. With **Shuktara Travels**, which we founded in 2018, I saw firsthand how messy corporate travel could be. Endless email threads, price checks, and policy exceptions consumed time and energy.

In 2025, we launched **StarFare**, a B2B travel platform designed to bring clarity, efficiency, and savings to corporate travel management.

## The Problem We Saw

- Corporates lacked a **single hub** for booking flights and hotels.  
- Price transparency was poor—too many intermediaries, too little clarity.  
- Finance teams struggled with reconciliation and policy enforcement.  
- Travelers felt unsupported when things went wrong.

## The StarFare Solution

- **Aggregated inventories**: Real-time flight and hotel data from global sources.  
- **Policy enforcement**: Built-in rules for approvals, budgets, and compliance.  
- **Self-service simplicity**: Employees book within policy without waiting on travel desks.  
- **Analytics and reporting**: Finance sees spend trends, exceptions, and savings.

## Why It’s Different

Most OTAs are consumer-first. StarFare is **corporate-first**. It optimizes for both the traveler’s convenience and the finance team’s compliance. That dual focus is what makes it powerful.

## My Vision

Corporate travel in Bangladesh deserves more than patchwork solutions. With StarFare, we aim to reduce costs, increase transparency, and give companies a **strategic travel advantage**.

The journey from Shuktara Travels to StarFare reflects a broader theme in my career: taking messy, outdated systems and replacing them with transparent, tech-driven platforms that actually work.
